# Expense Tracker Project

This is a small project that demonstrates the power of combining **TailwindCSS**, **styled components**, and **React Hook Form** in TypeScript files.

## Technologies Used

- **TailwindCSS** provides a comprehensive set of utility classes that make it easy to style your components with a consistent look and feel.
- **Styled components** allows you to write CSS in your JavaScript code, making it easy to encapsulate styles and create reusable components.
- **React Hook Form** is a lightweight library that helps you manage form state and validation in a simple and efficient way.

## Benefits of this Combination

By using these technologies together, this project provides a great example of how you can create a scalable and maintainable codebase. You can easily extend this project and apply the same technology to greater projects, making your development process more efficient.

Try out this project for yourself and see how you can implement these technologies in your own work.
